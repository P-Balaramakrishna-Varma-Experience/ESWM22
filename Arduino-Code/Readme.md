# checks and changes
- rpm rps rpms (units checkout errors chance)

- things speak to onem2m bluk code.
  - better plotting helps

- rpm code
  - 1 sec to measure !! (too slow) [try out]
  - interupt nature to normal nature !!
  - rpm code decides my minimun sampling rate

- motor code like sudheers

## Print
- (current PID calling time - Previous PID calling time) how long after is it called.
- (rpm, dutyvoltage) does it matter? Duty voltage consistly > 255.
- (error, cumerror, derivate, k*error, kd*cumerro) for some information


## Experiment
- rmp-dutyvoltage mattere?
- tuning (last 15 min)
